Ten years after the death of the crime lord, Geese Howard, the city of Southtown has become more peaceful.

Now a new fight tournament called "King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem" begins in the neighboring city known as Second Southtown.

Along with Terry Bogard, several characters related to the old era fighters of the King of Fighters tournaments participate in the event, including Rock Howard, the son of Geese Howard.
