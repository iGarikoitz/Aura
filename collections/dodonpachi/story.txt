The player assumes the role of a hunting squad against a race of mechanized aliens that appear recently and wreak havoc.

However, the most sinister and shocking secrets are below the surface, accessible only to those with the greatest courage and ability to read the whole game in two laps, where a seventh secret phase is unlocked.

There are three different ships, and each ship can play in Laser or Shooting modes.
