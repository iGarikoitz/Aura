It has been five years since the end of the second tournament, with the defeat of M. Bison and the Shadowloo organization, a new threat rises to power.

A religious cult known as the Illuminati is intended to restore balance in the world through the use of terrorist tactics such as kidnapping, DNA management and brainwashing.

Gill, leader of these, organizes the third tournament with the hope of finding the strongest fighters to repopulate the world after taking it to its destruction.
