## How to add my own games.

### Images
When you add a game, you have to include six images in JPG. Why in JPG image format? Because RetroFE works more fluid using JPG compared to PNG.

 1. **Cover** - Resolution: 460 x 690 pixels.
Game artwork with logo.
 2. **Fanart** -  Resolution: 1280 x 720 pixels.
Same Game artwork occupying the entire width.
 3. **Fanart blur** -  Resolution: 1280 x 720 pixels.
